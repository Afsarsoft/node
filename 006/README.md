## Clients & Servers

- Browser know how to send the web address to the server using domain and IP address.
- IP addresses are like address for computers.
- IP address is a unique identifier for a computer hosting the website.
- We use domain names to mask the IP addresses.

- When we go to a website, we make a GET request.
- When we send data to a server, we make a POST request.

- Communication between server and client/browser is via HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol).
- HTTP provides a set of instructions in how the communication should perform.

- In node, we write code to create server in back-end of our website to listen for request coming from browser/client.
